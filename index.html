                <strong>The Origins of Nations on a Global Scale</strong>
                <li>&nbsp;</li>
                <li>Whenever we start to think about the origin of a certain system, we will involuntarily bring up
                    geographical determinism, cultural determinism, and even racial determinism, and believe that a
                    certain political system and political habit
                    must be influenced by external forces or due to certain traditional habits during the historical
                    development process. Under this influence, a system with significant characteristics is extracted
                    from the entire nation or political
                    body through long-term evolution. From the perspective of future generations, this extracted system
                    can be used as a summary of a certain national historical stage, and can even be used as a summary
                    of the national character and its
                    historical origins. Undoubtedly, it is extremely important and worthy of in-depth study. The study
                    of the origins of systems can not only enhance our understanding of the history of a certain nation
                    or country after its system has
                    been fully constructed, but also allow us to understand the origins of its nationality and national
                    character, and to understand the different trends of national history in different geographical and
                    cultural environments. It can also
                    be used to explain how the inherent contradictions between various ethnic groups and countries in
                    today's world arise, and we can use this to think about how to bridge the contradictions between
                    different ethnic groups that have taken
                    different paths thousands of years ago, in order to achieve what Kant called "permanent peace".<a

                <strong>Debate on the Democratic Transformation of Modern China</strong>
                <li>&nbsp;</li>

                <li>Modern democracy, or the democratic theory we are discussing, is not in line with the classical
                    democracy of the Athenian city-state, nor is it homogeneous with the ideas produced under various
                    declarations and movements. Therefore, we
                    always have some misunderstandings about the term democracy and the actual essence of this ancient
                    system, which is the spirit of democracy. If the term democracy is placed under ideological
                    rhetoric, then this concept often departs
                    from actual institutional arrangements and is simply used as a means of propaganda to flaunt and
                    conceal one's weaknesses in institutional arrangements, or simply exists as a rhetoric. If democracy
                    is placed under what we call Western
                    rhetoric, we will always subconsciously associate it with parliamentary systems, electoral systems,
                    and elite politics. This phenomenon is not puzzling, as in reality, the democratic system of modern
                    Western countries is a system constructed
                    with parliamentary and electoral systems as its core. This system actually emphasizes a kind of
                    political "procedural justice", whose essence is to legitimize the exercise of public power,
                    preserve the existence of the system, prevent
                    the system from being destroyed by speculators and ambitious individuals, eliminate the natural
                    contradictions between various interest groups and people with different political tendencies in
                    society to the greatest extent possible,
                    and transfer the game to the political stage. In the theory of social contract, there is a saying
                    that each of us, together with all our forces, is placed under the highest guidance of public will,
                    and we accept each member as an inseparable
                    part of the whole in the community. Therefore, whether viewed from the democratic system of ancient
                    Greece or the modern electoral system, the commonality that exists in different systems is the
                    paradigm of democracy, which is what
                    Rousseau meant by the guidance of public will, that is, the generation and exercise of public power.
                    Whether this process is legal and recognized by the participants of democratic politics is a single
                    indicator for judging whether
                    a political entity is democratic. Correspondingly, this paradigm reflects the spirit of democracy,
                    and the continuous development of democratic theory aims to achieve true legalization of public
                    power through various systems under
                    different frameworks. The goal of constructing a democratic system is to achieve the pursuit of
                    liberalism under a gradually improving system.<a href="https://qiumu.club/121278">Read More...</a>
